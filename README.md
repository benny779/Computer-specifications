# Computer specifications

Our ERP system is simple and we enter the data manually. \
Since the computer specifications also need to be entered, I wrote the tool that brings the details and saves to a text file. \
The data is checked using Win-Api.

The tool exports the data below:

* computer name
* manufacturer
* model
* Serial No
* Processor model
* Memory
* Volume and type of disc
* Operating system version
* MAC address

Optional, check the end date of the warranty with the manufacturer (using Web-Api), currently for Lenovo only.
